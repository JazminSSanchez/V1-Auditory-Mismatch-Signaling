# TDT single unit analysis pipeline
v1.0
A selection of tools in MATLAB for analysing tungsten single neuron data recorded using TDT systems. 

The analysis pipeline involves preparing the TDT tank data for PCA sorting, and then re-associating sorted spike data with sitmuli presented during recording. The output is in a proprietary 'bst' format, which is similar to a TDT tank and has custom functions for easy further analysis.

Code was written by Adam Hockley and slightly modified by Jazmin Sanchez Sanchez
## 1) JazminSorting.m Combines multiple blocks recorded on the same neuron
Script for PCA & k-means spike sorking on single channel TDT data
Then converts to bst format, and some example plotting

Requires TDTbin2mat and matlab SDK in matlab path, and beautify function.
TDTBin2Mat from the [TDT Matlab SDK](https://www.tdt.com/docs/sdk/offline-data-analysis/offline-data-matlab/).

## 2) Using custom functions to easily access spike data from bst.
The following two functions provide a simple method for querying spike times from the bst formatted data.

### build_sb_jazmin.m 
This code allow users to construct SUPERBLOCK (sb_cell: cell array with only one field), which is the first step for spike analysis. 
Superblocks cell is then fed into bbst in the next step.

### BST_TS.m
Outputs the stimulus trial numbers corresponding to requested stimulus parameters. e.g.  Get the F1 and F2 used:

`SelectedTrials = BST_TS(bst,'type','ODD-DES-DEV');`

### BST_GS.m
Outputs the spike timings that occurred within the queried trials. e.g. to find spike times for neuron 1 during the trials from above:

`SpikeTimes = 1000 * BST_GS(bst,SelectedTrials,'SW');`

### bbst_jazmin.m
Load data for one channel - just getting epoks not spikes

### BST_AddType_jazmin.m
This function is used to find oddballs & deviants etc in a bst. It will add the info to the bst epoch allowing the trials to be searchable.
