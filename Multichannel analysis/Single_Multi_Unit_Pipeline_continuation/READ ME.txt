1) Follow the # TDT single unit analysis pipeline steps. (ADAM H.) Modified by Jazmin Sanchez 2024- June 2025
A selection of tools in MATLAB for analysing multi-channel single neuron data recorded using TDT systems. 

The analysis pipeline involves preparing the TDT tank data for sorting, and then re-associating sorted spike data with sitmuli presented during recording. The output is in a proprietary 'bst' format, which is similar to a TDT tank and has custom functions for easy further analysis.


## 1) AddTypesJazmin.m & AddTypesJazmin_MUA.m
Adds the types (e.g. ODD-DEV-ASC) to the bst stimuli table. Allows easy searching of spikes based on stimulus type in later analysis.
## Should be checked for accurate type labeling by all users!

## 2) CreateSpikeTable_Jazmin.m & CreateSpikeTable_Jazmin_MUA.m
Combines data from each bst and saves into one big table of spike data correspaonding to different stimuli used. Also produces PSTH plots for each neuron.

The restulting data table should contain all the data you need, and be small enough to quickly load, analyse and plot any way you want.

## 3) ReadFunctionsMultichannel.m & ReadFunctionsMultichannelMUA.m (MUA ending stands for multiunits as recognized by the spikesorting)

	1.1) SignificanceWindow.m
	1.2) CSI_bootstrapping.m
		1.2.1) CSI_bootstrap2.m

	*** From which we get the following .mat files:
		- spiketable_Aud_Sig.mat
		This table contains the path, unit, the spikes corresponding to each condition, location, and if the unit is auditory and significant (1 or 0).
		- NormalizedIndexesTable.mat
		Contains normalized indexes and STD, DEV and CTR values
		- SignificanceWindowTable.mat
		Contains if DEV or STD conditions have a significat response (2 standard deviations above basal activity) and the normalized values for each condition and basal activity. 


## 4) HistogramsSpikesTableMUA_Generator & HistogramsSpikesTableMUA_Generator_MUA

You get back the following matrix:

	- HistogramsSpikesTable.mat

## 5) Generate_CA1_DG_spiketables_IndexTables.mlx
It generates a mat file with all the unit and multiunit information from multichannel recordings
It also generates tables in mat format with the information from the tungsten channels as well as the multichannel recordings (Used later in "Index_CA1_DG_median.mlx")
